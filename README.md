# What is CSRF
XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a user into performing unwanted actions on a website where they are currently authenticated. This is achieved by sending a malicious link or form to the user, which when clicked or submitted, sends a request to the website using the user's existing session. This can allow an attacker to perform actions such as changing the user's password or making unauthorized transactions. To prevent XSRF attacks, websites can use a technique called "synchronizer token pattern" which includes a unique token with each request that the server checks before processing the request.

Sample code to demo CSRF
Here is an example of how to implement CSRF protection in a Node.js Express application:

Install the csurf package: npm install csurf

In your Express app, add the csurf middleware to your middleware stack:

Copy code
const csrf = require('csurf');
const csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });
app.use(csrfProtection);
In your views, add the csrf token to your forms as a hidden input field:
```
<form>
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="{{csrfToken}}">
  <!-- your form fields here -->
</form>
```
In your routes, add the csrf middleware to the route handlers that handle sensitive requests:
```
app.post('/sensitive-route', csrfProtection, (req, res) => {
  /// Handle the request
});
```
In case of ajax request, you can include token in a header as well

```
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: '/sensitive-route',
    headers: {
        'x-csrf-token': $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')
    },
    data: { /* ... */ },
    success: function(response) { /* ... */ }
});
```
This example uses the csurf package to handle CSRF protection, but there are other libraries available as well.
Please keep in mind that this is just an example, you need to test it with your specific use case and validate it.
